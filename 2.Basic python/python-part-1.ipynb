    "1. **Readable:** Python is a very readable language.\n",

    "2. **Easy to Learn:** Learning python is easy as this is a expressive and high level programming language, which means it is easy to understand the language and thus easy to learn.\n",
    "3. **Cross platform:**Python is available and can run on various operating systems such as Mac, Windows, Linux, Unix etc. This makes it a cross platform and portable language.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Open Source:** Python is a open source programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Large standard library:** Python comes with a large standard library that has some handy codes and functions which we can use while writing code in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Free:** Python is free to download and use. This means you can download it for free and use it in your application. See: Open Source Python License\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Supports exception handling:** If you are new, you may wonder what is an exception? An exception is an event that can occur during program exception and can disrupt the normal flow of program. Python supports exception handling which means we can write less error prone code and can test various scenarios that can cause an exception later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Advanced features:** Supports generators and list comprehensions. We will cover these features later.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Automatic memory management:** Python supports automatic memory management which means the memory is cleared and freed automatically. You do not have to bother clearing the memory."

    "An equal (=) sign is used to store a value in a variable. Until then, we did not use any variables in the chapters. So whenever we press any key number, text or statement in the Python console and press Enter, its output shows the next line. But if we store a value in a variable (with the equal sign) and press enter, then the next line will not output. Rather, the right side of the equal sign will be stored in the variant on the left side of the equal sign, which we can use to name it in the next statement.\n",
    "Variable is like a small box made in computer memory, in which anything can be stored. When we declare a variable, the computer determines certain memory for that variable. Each variable's memory address is unique. The value of the program can be stored in the memory location filled in the name of the variable name. Once again, using that name, the value of that location can be accessed and used to be useful."
